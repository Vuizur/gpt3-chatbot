# GPT-3 Chatbot

A simple chatbot that uses GPT-3. It has colors and offers customizable truncating of the conversation to save your credits.

Additionally it has the function of correcting your spelling mistakes (which also uses GPT-3).

First put your OpenAI API key in a text file called openai-key.txt. After that install Poetry, then run `poetry install`, and then execute the script by running `poetry run python ./gpt3_chatbot/chatbot.py`

For Windows, I recommend downloading the new Terminal app from the store and starting chat.ps1. (You can press Ctrl+C to stop the program and press the up arrow and then Enter to start a new conversation)
